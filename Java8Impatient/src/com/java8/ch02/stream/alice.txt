~alice~ - Poem by E Nigma
The girl had a golden street gun
Keen sight with a level mean streak
Rabbits be warned, she is a killer
The karrots she carries hold gleam

You could say that Alice was a wanderer
Almost lost within her wondering 
Found out through her meandering
She said anything could have meaning

Profound in what you call absurd
Seemingly simple, her totality
Her looks a fatal actuality
Dug more graves then you've ever seen

Don't mistake her calm for some carelessness
Carefree but concise through her connection
She voiced love for her condition
All I have left is her memory
