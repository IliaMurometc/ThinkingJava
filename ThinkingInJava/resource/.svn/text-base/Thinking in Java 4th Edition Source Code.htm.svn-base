Thinking in Java 4<sup>th</sup> Edition</a> Source Code</H1>

<h2 align="center">Instructions for downloading, installing and testing the source code</h2>

<ol>
<li><a href="CodeDownload.php">Download the source code zip file from this link</a>.<p>

<li>Create a directory in which to install the code. For these
instructions, we'll refer to this directory as <b>C:\TIJ4\code</b>.<p>

<li>Using Winzip or some other zip utility, extract the zip file
into the <b>C:\TIJ4\code</b> directory. When you're done, you should see
several levels of directories, and in the <b>C:\TIJ4\code</b> directory,
you'll see, among other things, subdirectories corresponding to the chapters
in the book.<p>

<li>Install the Java JDK SE5 or later from the
<a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp">download site at Sun</a>.
You'll also eventually want the documentation,
which is available further down on that page.
You may also choose to install Java SE6; the code will work with that as well.
Note that the most reliable approach is to install to the default directories.<p>

<li>Add the <b>bin</b> directory of your JDK to your path.<p>

<li>Set the CLASSPATH in your computer's environment. For Windows machines, right-click
on the "My Computer" icon and select "Properties." Then select the "Advanced" tab
and click the "Environment Variables" button at the bottom. Under "System Variables,"
look to see if there's already a "CLASSPATH" variable. If there is, double click and
add<br>
<b>;.;..;C:\TIJ4\code;</b><br>
to the end of the current entry. If there is no "CLASSPATH" variable, click the "New"
button and enter<br>
<b>CLASSPATH</b><br>
In the "Variable name" box, and<br>
<b>.;..;C:\TIJ4\code;</b><br>
In the "Variable value" box, then click "OK". To verify that your classpath has been
set, start a command prompt (see below), then enter <b>set</b> and look for the
<b>CLASSPATH</b> information in the output.<p>

<li>Install the <b>Ant</b> build tool by following the instructions you will
find in the <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant download</a>. <font
color="red">Note:</font> <b>Ant</b> is not required in order to compile the
examples in the book. It is used to automate the process, but you can also
compile each example individually (once you have the CLASSPATH set, as described
above) using the <b>javac</b> command-line compiler that was installed when you
completed the previous step (note that you may have to set the Windows PATH to
point to <b>javac.exe</b>). To compile a file called <b>MyProgram.java</b>, you
type <b>javac MyProgram.java</b>. <p>

<li>Start a command prompt in the <b>C:\TIJ4\code</b> directory. To do this in
Windows, press the "Start" button, then select "Run" and type "cmd" and press "OK."
then type<br>
<b>cd C:\TIJ4\code</b><br>
into the resulting command window.<p>

<li>At this point you should be able to start a command prompt in <b>C:\TIJ4\code</b>
and type <b>ant build</b>, and the build should successfully compile all the chapters
up to the <b>io</b> chapter, where it will fail with an error message about a missing
library. If you only need to work with chapters before <b>io</b> for now, this will
suffice for awhile.<p>

<li>You can also move into individual chapters and type <b>ant</b> (to compile and execute
the code in that chapter) or <b>ant build</b> (to compile the code only).<p>

<li>To build the entire code base, you'll need to install the additional libraries.
These include:<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.xom.nu">XOM</a>
<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=22866">Javassist</a>
<li>The <b>javaws.jar</b> library, which comes with the standard Java installation,
but which you must explicitly place in your classpath (described below).

<li><a href="http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/">The
Eclipse SWT library</a>. Click on the most recent build
number, then scroll down to "SWT Binary and Source" and
select the file corresponding to your platform. Further details
about finding the jar file are in the book under the heading "Installing SWT."
</ul>

<p>In general, you can install the above Jar files by placing them in the <b>jre/lib/ext</b>
directory that is part of the "Java Runtime" that will be set up when you install the
Java SE5 or Java SE6 development kit. You may have to hunt around for the JRE, but it
can often be found under your "Program Files" directory, under "Java."<p>

<li>Alternatively, you can explicitly install each of the Jar files. To do this, you
must add each one to your CLASSPATH, following the directions shown earlier on this page.
However, <i>you must also include the name of the Jar file in the CLASSPATH entry</i>.
For example, if you put the <b>xom.jar</b> file in a directory called
<b>C:\TIJ4\libraries\</b>, then the associated CLASSPATH entry would be
<b>C:\TIJ4\libraries\xom.jar;</b>.<p>

<li>This code is designed to work outside of IDEs. Because packages are not introduced
until later chapters, and some of the fancier IDEs like Eclipse require all code to be
in packages, if you want to use the code inside those IDEs you will have to make some
adjustments (however, see the <b>Eclipse.py</b> program in the download package for
some help). Different IDEs have different requirements and it may be more trouble than
it's worth while you're getting started; instead, you may want to begin with a more basic editor
like <a href="http://www.jedit.org/">JEdit</a>.
